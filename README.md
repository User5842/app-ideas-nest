# App Ideas NestJS

This NestJS application will handle server-side logic for all projects I implement from the [app-ideas](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas) repository.

The file structure resembles the tiered system seen in the above repository. Underneath the `src` folder is tiered folders containing the application logic for the different projects. I named the project folders using the same name in the project listing.

I decided to use NestJS as I believe it's good to get exposure to new tools and learn from them. Also, as Angular heavily inspires Nest, it makes sense for me to use it as Angular was the first framework I had exposure to.

I'm a fan of creating projects with the _least_ amount of necessary boilerplate, and that's what I tried to do here by following the [alternative route](https://docs.nestjs.com/#alternatives).

## TODO

- [x] Add Prettier
- [x] Add TypeScript eslint
- [] Add linting rule for spacing between imports
